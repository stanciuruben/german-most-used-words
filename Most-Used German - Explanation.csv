"Hello everyone

This transcript of 1781 nouns, 1054 verbs, 648 adjectives & 253 adverbs
is from A Frequency Dictionary of German: Core Vocabulary for Learners
by Routledge - Taylor & Francis Group. The book was based on a
4.2 million words research ""evenly divided between spoken, literature,
newspaper and academic texts"", and contains nouns, adjectives,
verbs, adverbs & function words with 1 sample sentence in German
for each word. The reason why I made this transcript is because the
book is only organized by frequency, and not by word type.

The 5 lists in this document are sorted by frequency, so the first word
in every list is the most-used and the last is the least-used.
The comma always means a different translation, so even if the meanings
are similar, you should treat them as different translations.

Study these words using apps like Quizlet or Anki that will give you
the pronunciation, otherwise it will be very confusing to learn them.
For Quizlet, look for the option ""import"" while making an unit
so that you can copy/paste the words. For Anki (on laptop) you can
download this sheet as a .csv (File > Download) then import it into Anki.

Keep in mind that word meanings (specially for verbs and adverbs)
are not easily understood using only a vocabulary list, because the
meanings can change depending on the context in which the word is used.
So you should use this list as a reference for all the words you need
to learn right now, guide yourself with the provided translation(s),
then google every word that you're unsure about."
